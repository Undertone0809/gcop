## Why Choose GCOP?

- **Time-Saving**: Automate the often time-consuming task of crafting meaningful commit messages.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a clear and informative commit history across your projects and teams.
- **Flexibility**: Adapt GCOP to your specific needs with customizable AI model settings.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improve team understanding of code changes with well-structured, AI-generated commit messages.

## Project-Level Configuration

One of GCOP's most powerful features is its two-level configuration system:

- **User config**: Your personal settings with API keys and preferences
- **Project config**: Repository-specific rules that all team members follow

This means you can define exactly what a good commit message looks like for each project. For example, your frontend team might require component names in commit messages, while your API team might need endpoint references.

Simply run `gcop init-project` in your repo and customize the commit template - every team member will automatically follow the same standards!
